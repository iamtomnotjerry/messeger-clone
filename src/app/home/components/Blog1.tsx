            <p className="text-gray-600">The common thinking of many people is that eating meat is the reason why they are overweight. But what if I told you meat isn&apos;t the reason you&apos;re overweight?

Prehistoric people only knew how to hunt, but did not know how to farm. Their main food is meat from animals living around them. They absolutely only eat meat, but they have good health and a strong body.

If that&apos;s not enough, we come to the Mongols. The ancient Mongols were famous for their ferocity, their armies waged war across the five continents. Because of the geography and terrain where they lived, it seemed impossible to grow crops at that time. What makes them invincible is the meat that comes from hunting. Eating only meat, the Mongols had tremendous strength, extremely strong bodies and endurance. Can conquer harsh environments like the cold Russian winter.

Or the Eskimos are living in the North Pole right now. Because of the Arctic weather, growing crops is impossible. Their food is mainly meat. But contrary to modern people, even though they only eat meat, the Eskimos&apos; vitality is extremely resilient when they can live with the cold Arctic. And even though they only eat meat, they are not at all overweight like we think.</p>
